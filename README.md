# Refactor VBA Code and Measure Performance

## Overview of Project
### Purpose of Project
In this challenge, I refactored code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information from the original code. Then I determined how I was able to refactor the code successfully to make the VBA script run faster. 

**Refactor**: editing exisiting code to make it more efficientâ€”by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read

### Background of Project
The original code **AllStocksAnalysis()** compares stock market stocks. It works well for a dozen stocks so I refractored code **AllStocksAnalysisRefactored()** to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years and improved the code so that it runs faster than the original code. 

---
## Results
There are three key differences between the original and refractored code. 
1. The refractored code contains three output arrays: *Dim tickerVolumes(12) As Long, Dim tickerStartingPrices(12) As Single,* and *Dim tickerEndingPrices(12) As Single*. 
2. The refracted code contains a formatting loop while the original code runs that as a seperate subroutine. 
3. The original code contains a nested loop while the refractored code contains three loops. 
        
        * Original Code: A loop to increase volume over all the rows in the spreadsheet nested inside a loop that initializes the tickerVolumes to zero.
        
        * Refractored Code: A loop to initialize the tickerVolumes to zero. A loop to increase volume over all the rows in the spreadsheet. A loop to format the spreadsheet.     

As a result, the codes produce the same stock performances, but the refractored code executes faster. 

### Stock Performance  
Of the twelve stocks this code compared, the best stocks were ENPH and RUN because they are the only stocks with an increase in return in both 2017 and 2018. Of the two, ENPH had significant double digit returns both years with 129.5% in 2017 and 81.0% in 2018 while RUN had returns of 5.5% and 84% respectively. The worst stock was TERP because it was the only stock with negative returns in both years.  

### Execution Time 
Each subroutine contains code that measures and reports on the execution time - *MsgBox "This code ran in " & (endTime - startTime) & " seconds for the year " & (yearValue)*. The images below 

On average, the refractored code runs half a second faster. For the year 2017 and 2018, AllStocksAnalysisRefractored() runs approximately .57 and .53 seconds faster respectively than AllStocksAnalysis(). The images below show the message box results.
